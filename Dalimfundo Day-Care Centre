            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>Dalimfundo Day Care Centre was founded by Pastor Sunnyboy Mntakwende, who spent his formative years on the farms of Delmas. Launched in <strong>2013</strong> at Vlakplaats Farm with just a handful of children, our centre has since blossomed into a vibrant community that now proudly serves over <strong>400 children</strong>. A pivotal moment in our journey came in <strong>2017</strong>, when we relocated to Delmas Botleng N12, allowing us to expand our facilities and better cater to the needs of our growing community. Driven by Pastor Sunnyboy’s heartfelt passion for the well-being of children, we are committed to fostering a nurturing environment where every child can thrive. Today, we are fortunate to employ over <strong>20 dedicated staff members</strong>, all of whom share a deep commitment to nurturing young minds and instilling a love for learning.</p>
